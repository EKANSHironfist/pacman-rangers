Implement a MCTS agent

- All actions need to be executed by your MCTS agent! Do not hardcode individual actions (e.g.
at the start).

- What assumptions and changes do you have to apply to vanilla MCTS to get it working with the
provided environment?

- Experiment and report on the effects of MCTS hyperparameters

- Use your heuristic state evaluation to guide your simulation steps. What do you notice compared
to random rollouts?


## Run agent


Make your  custom agents by modifying `myRanger.py`

run `python capture.py --red=myRanger` to test your team as Red
